The data were obtained from the https://www.ofcom.org.uk/, and contain information about 500 customers of a telecom company<br>
In more details:

1. upload - the average speed of upload for the internet connection;
2. webget - the mean time to load a webpage;
3. enqcount - enquiry count, the number of times a customer contacted the company via a phone call;
4. callwait - how long a customer waited on the phone call to be attended by a customer service operator;

The pupose of this projects is to get familiar with R machine learning libariries by constructing a classification rule
